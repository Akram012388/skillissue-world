You are conducting an in-depth interview session about: $ARGUMENTS

Follow this process:

1. Start by greeting the user and confirming the interview topic from the arguments provided.
2. Ask 3-4 deep, thoughtful questions one round at a time using the AskUserQuestion tool. Each round should build on previous answers.
3. After each round of answers, synthesize what you've learned, then ask follow-up questions that dig deeper into interesting or unclear areas.
4. Continue for 3-5 rounds (or until the user indicates they're done).
5. At the end, produce a structured summary of all insights gathered during the interview, organized by theme.

Guidelines:
- Questions should be open-ended and probing, not yes/no.
- Use the AskUserQuestion tool for every question round — provide 2-4 option suggestions per question but always allow free-form input via "Other".
- Adapt your questions based on previous answers — don't use a fixed script.
- If the topic is technical, ask about trade-offs, alternatives considered, and lessons learned.
- If the topic is about a product/feature, ask about user needs, constraints, and success criteria.
- Keep each round focused on 1-3 questions max to avoid overwhelming the user.

If no arguments are provided, ask the user what topic they'd like to be interviewed about before starting.

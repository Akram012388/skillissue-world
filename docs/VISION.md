# VISION

## SkillIssue.world

**The No-BS Encyclopedia for Official Agent Skills – Search, Copy, and Go.**

---

## The Problem

The 2026 agent skills boom created a mess:
- skills.sh is cluttered with random community submissions
- skillsdirectory.com drowns in noise and paywalls
- Devs waste time filtering garbage from gold
- No single source of truth for *official* org-maintained skills

## The Solution

A clean, curated, text-only directory of **officially maintained skills only**.

No indie submissions. No "soy dev" contributions. No social features. No ads.

Just pure signal for the developer who has **3 seconds between terminal tabs**.

## Core Philosophy

```
Speed > Choice > Completeness
```

This is the magna carta of SkillIssue.world.

We're building for the dev mid-flow, not the person researching agent ecosystems. Every design decision filters through this hierarchy.

## What "Official" Means

A skill is official if and only if:
- Hosted under an organization's official GitHub namespace
- Maintained by the org (not a personal repo "blessed" by them)
- If Stripe's engineer hosts it on their personal repo, it's not official. Period.

We index: `vercel-labs/*`, `anthropics/*`, `openai/*`, `supabase/*`, `github/*`, etc.

We don't index: `random-dev/cool-skill-i-made`

## The Name

"Skill issue" is willfully playful. It's a gaming meme. It's self-aware.

Life is not about being serious all the time. We're building useful software, but we're also having fun.

The domain: **skillissue.world** — blocked on Vercel, ready to ship.

## North Star Metrics

1. **Time-to-copy**: How fast can a dev land on a skill and copy the install command?
2. **Return visits**: Are devs bookmarking us as their go-to reference?
3. **Zero friction**: Did they accomplish their goal without a single unnecessary click?

---

## What We're NOT Building

- A community platform
- A social network for skills
- A marketplace
- A place for random submissions
- A competitor to awesome-lists (we're complementary)

---

## The Bet

Official skills from reputable orgs will remain the gold standard. As Claude Code, Codex CLI, Cursor, OpenCode, and Gemini CLI mature, developers will need a trusted reference.

We're that reference.

## Philosophy

### Why "Official Only"?

The agent skills ecosystem is noisy. Community submissions vary wildly in quality. We filter to org-maintained gold so you can trust what you install.

### Why "Skill Issue"?

It's a gaming meme. It's self-aware. Life doesn't have to be serious.

### Why No Social Features?

You came to copy an install command, not to comment. We respect your time.

## FAQ

**Q: Why isn't [skill] listed?**
A: Either it's not from an official org namespace, or we haven't indexed it yet. Open an issue.

**Q: Can I submit my skill?**
A: Only if it's under your organization's official GitHub namespace (not personal).

**Q: Why default to Claude Code?**
A: It's the Big Dog. Other agents are one toggle away.

**Q: Is this affiliated with Vercel/Anthropic/etc?**
A: No. Independent project by [@CodeAkram](https://x.com/CodeAkram).

**Q: Can I use this data in my project?**
A: Yes, it's MIT licensed. Attribution appreciated.
